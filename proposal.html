    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Many college students find it difficult to balance their many duties; between completing 
            all their homework assignments and dealing with extracurriculars, it can be hard to maintain
            their social lives. Especially for young adults, “surrounding yourself with a positive 
            social network increases your self-esteem, and “enables [one] to create boundaries that 
            encourage communication, trust, and conflict management” (University of Nebraska). 
            In this project, we hope to address the question, “How can we help college students successfully 
            manage their educational tasks, while also forming and building on important relationships
            with those around them?” We found that while many schools are aware of the connection
            between workload stress and social networks, there are few solutions. The University 
            of Washington for example, offers workshops to assist with stress and mental health, 
            but does not help students deal with their workload in a positive and effective way 
            in the first place (University of Washington). Additionally, such resources may not be 
            readily available for all students, such as commuters and those studying abroad. There
            have been some approaches to fix this problem, Google Calendar being one such example. 
            They offer the ability to create a group calendar by sharing through your email (Google Calendar). Although this
            offers the ability to view other people's schedule, there is no way to communicate with collaborators.</p>
