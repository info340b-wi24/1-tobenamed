    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Many college students find it difficult to balance their many duties; between completing all their homework assignments and dealing with extracurriculars, it can be hard to maintain their social lives. Especially for young adults, “surrounding yourself with a positive social network increases your self-esteem, and “enables [one] to create boundaries that encourage communication, trust, and conflict management” (University of Nebraska). In this project, we hope to address the question, “How can we help college students successfully manage their educational tasks, while also forming and building on important relationships with those around them?” We found that while many schools are aware of the connection between workload stress and social networks, there are few solutions. The University of Washington for esxample, offers workshops to assist with stress and mental health, but does not help students deal with their workload in a positive and effective way in the first place (University of Washington). Additionally, such resources may not be readily available for all students, such as commuters and those studying abroad. There have been some approaches to fix this problem, Google Calendar being one such example. They offer the ability to create a group calendar by sharing through your email (Google Calendar). Although this offers the ability to view other people's schedule, there is no way to communicate with collaborators.</p>

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p> Our application targets those who find themselves lacking motivation and need motivation to get their daily tasks done. We expect those users to be involved in education, businesses, personal projects, and people who just want to find a new way to see what their friends are doing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The users will share their daily to-do list each day, decide whether to put it as private/public and then are encouraged to check off their lists as the day progresses. They can also see their public feed to check in with how their friends are doing, and send motivational messages to get each other through the day!
    </p>
    <h3> The interaction features we intend to have included: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em class="example">Creating a To-Do List:</em> The user will start each day creating a list of items they want to accomplish (Ex: Laundry, Lunch with Sean, CSE HW 1) and choose between a public or private list (Whether they want to have their list on their friends feed)
        </li>
        <li>
            <em class="example">Checking off the To-Do List:</em> Throughout the day or end of the night, the user will be able to check off their items. Once completed, the to-do list will be celebrated. If the user made their list public, there will be an announcement to their friends about completing the list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em class="example">An Interactive Social Feed:</em> As mentioned, there will be a feed for the users friend's public lists. Users will be able to comment on peoples progress & send motivational messages/emoticons along the way. 
            <ul>
                <li><em class="example">Filtering Friends:</em> The user will have the ability to filter out friends that are busy or free at certain time frames. This allows for it to be clearer for the user to interpret their schedules without seeing too much unnecessary information.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em class="example">Adding Friends & seeing availability</em> We plan to implement a feature to allow people to add friends and allow users to see their availability
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The users will be viewing a calendar that looks similar to google calendar. They can sync their contacts/share their calendar with their friends. They would also be seeing the calendars of their friends. We won't be using an external source for data.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want to focus on  college students trying to stay on top of their busy schedules while making time to hang out with their friends. Our app would have a few of the functionalities of google calendar such as being able to schedule your daily tasks and share your calendar.  However, the main difference would be that there is a social element where they can add friends to their account. When they log into their account they have the ability to see their friends calendars which would be helpful if they are trying to see when they are free to meet up. This is a good solution to our problem because by seeing everyones elses tasks and to do, it will motivate them to work towards finishing their goals. Additionally it makes it easy to find times when your friends are free so you can catch up once in a while.
