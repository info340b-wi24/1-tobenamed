    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Many college students find it difficult to balance their many duties; between completing 
            all their homework assignments and dealing with extracurriculars, it can be hard to maintain
            their social lives. Especially for young adults, “surrounding yourself with a positive 
            social network increases your self-esteem, and “enables [one] to create boundaries that 
            encourage communication, trust, and conflict management” (University of Nebraska). 
            In this project, we hope to address the question, “How can we help college students successfully 
            manage their educational tasks, while also forming and building on important relationships
            with those around them?” We found that while many schools are aware of the connection
            between workload stress and social networks, there are few solutions. The University 
            of Washington for example, offers workshops to assist with stress and mental health, 
            but does not help students deal with their workload in a positive and effective way 
            in the first place (University of Washington). Additionally, such resources may not be 
            readily available for all students, such as commuters and those studying abroad. There
            have been some approaches to fix this problem, Google Calendar being one such example. 
            They offer the ability to create a group calendar by sharing through your email (Google Calendar). Although this
            offers the ability to view other people's schedule, there is no way to communicate with collaborators.</p>

    <h2>App description</h2>
        <p>Here are a few types of information the users will be viewing: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The users will be viewing a calendar that looks a little like the google calendar. </li>
            <li>They can sync their contacts/share their calendar with their friends. </li>
            <li>They would also be seeing the calendars of their friends and all of
                the daily tasks that they choose to make public.</li>
        </ul>

        <P>We want to focus on  college students trying to stay on top of their busy schedules while making time to hang out with their friends. 
           Our app would have a few of the functionalities of google calendar such as being able to schedule your daily tasks and share your calendar. 
           However, the main difference would be that there is a social element where they can add friends to their account. 
           When they log into their account they have the ability to see their friends calendars which would be helpful 
           if they are trying to see when they are free to meet up. This is a good solution to our problem because by seeing everyones
           elses tasks and to do, it will motivate them to work towards finishing their goals. Additionally it makes it easy to find
           times when your friends are free so you can catch up once in a while.
        </P>
